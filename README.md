#  Cities in WikipediA

##   Our Website
The website is an informational website for searching information about cities in Isreal,It gives the user the option to search for any city in israel by an autocomplete text field, and serive the information about this city as it is in WikipediA  today.

## SO HOW DOES IT WORK
The app uses an API fetched from
    
   https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/records/1.0/search/?dataset=worldcitiespop&rows=10000&facet=country&refine.country=il

Which is an api specific for  information about cities acording to country,
The app showes to the user all the cities in Israel while he/she is tyeping the name of he city.
If the user picked a city from the option, an informatonal ifram will open to to display the information about this city as it is in WikipediA today
